-- 1. addresses_included should ALWAYS equal your total insider count (322)
-- 2. If addresses_included varies, the CROSS JOIN matrix isn't working
-- 3. Most recent insider_supply_pct should match your activity data (0.93%)
-- 4. Each row represents a complete snapshot of ALL insider balances for that day
